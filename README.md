# Port Scanner Tool (Python)

This is a simple TCP port scanner built with Python. It checks if common ports are open on a given IP address or domain.

## How It Works

- Uses the `socket` library to attempt TCP connections
- Scans a predefined list of common ports (e.g. 22, 80, 443)
- Prints out any ports that are open

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo or download the script
2. In your terminal, run:
python3 port_scanner.py

3. Enter the IP address or domain when prompted

## Example Output

[+] Port 22 is OPEN
[+] Port 80 is OPEN
